## Environment:
The arena unfurls from a hazy memory: a sprawling, multi-tiered library where towering shelves do not just hold scrolls, but are carved from the varied architectures of forgotten empires. Marble columns seamlessly transition into adobe walls, and papyrus-lined alcoves open onto bustling market stalls overflowing with spices and artifacts from a thousand trade routes. Here, the central thoroughfare is the surface of an impossibly vast, shimmering hypersaline lake—the Dead Sea itself—where buoyant barges serve as merchant kiosks, their hawkers' shouts echoing with a dreamlike clarity over the eerily calm waters. Gravity is a fluid concept; one can clamber up walls of fossilized knowledge or drift weightlessly across the buoyant currents. A whispered thought of "lost wisdom" might spontaneously manifest a blinding cloud of salt crystals, or a "cross-purpose" argument could shatter the very ground into a maze of floating platforms, each bearing a fragment of civilization's dream-spun history.
