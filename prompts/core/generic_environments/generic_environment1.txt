## Environment:
The arena is the abyssal resting place of a colossal vessel, its skeletal frame now a monumental cathedral of corrosion, utterly subsumed by crushing darkness and numbing cold. Light is an alien trespasser here, cast only by the harsh, narrow beams of specialized salvage submersibles, their multi-bladed thrusters slowly churning the icy blackness. These powerful deep-sea craft, reminiscent of armored, submerged helicopters, kick up plumes of ancient silt that further obscure vision and create unpredictable, disorienting currents. Combatants navigate a treacherous landscape of ruptured bulkheads, razor-sharp debris, and collapsing decks, where every clumsy movement can dislodge tons of unstable metal or tear through critical suit components. Momentum is a luxury; the deep water resists every exertion, sapping strength with each labored kick and pull. The gnashing churn of a submersible's thrusters is a swift death sentence, while the constant threat of hypothermia, suit rupture from impact, or exhaustion in the unforgiving pressure drives every desperate action.
