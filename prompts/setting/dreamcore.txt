## SETTING:
Static Memory: Arenas are unnervingly empty, half-remembered locations like sterile hotel pools and looping school hallways, connected by impossible geometry. Reality is soft and unreliable, warping in response to strong emotions; combat is a disorienting struggle against an environment that refuses to remain solid or consistent.
