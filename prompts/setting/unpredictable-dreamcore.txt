## SETTING:
Waking Dream: Familiar locations are stitched together with a dream's nonsensical logic, where hallways loop and doors open to impossible places. Combat follows a loose interpretation of physics, but events are primarily driven by narrative association, where a stray thought can manifest a flying car or a pun can become dangerously literal.
