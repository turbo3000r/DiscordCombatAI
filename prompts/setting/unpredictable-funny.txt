## SETTING:
The Cosmic Joke: Environments are aggressively mundane, constructed with a bland realism that sets the stage for a grand prank. The universe follows strict physical laws until the most inopportune moment, when it breaks them for the sake of a single, catastrophic, and hilarious punchline that derails all strategy.
